# Breast Cancer Prediction Model
=====================================

## Overview
------------

This repository contains a breast cancer prediction model using logistic regression. The model is trained on the [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data) and can be used to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on various features.

## Dataset
-------------

The dataset used for training and testing the model is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset, which can be found in the `Breast_cancer_dataset.csv` file.

## Model
---------

The trained logistic regression model is saved in the `Breast_cancer_model.pkl` file.

## Code
------

The code for training and testing the model can be found in the `Breast_cancer_Prediction.ipynb` file.

## Requirements
--------------

To run the code, you'll need to install the following dependencies:

* `scikit-learn`
* `pandas`
* `numpy`
* `matplotlib`
*  `seaborn`

You can install these dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
